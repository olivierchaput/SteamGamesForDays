# SteamGamesForDays
 
Super simple chunk of code that uses Xpath to find the list of steam games that are temporarily free so I can quickly purchase them before the end of the special pricing
 
- [ ] Automate the search every day
- [ ] Automatically purchase the game or add it to my cart
- [ ] Add a notification system so I don't have to connect to my computer to see the output
